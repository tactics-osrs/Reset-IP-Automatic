•As well as the static ip change option on https://github.com/tactics-osrs/Batch-Menu.



## IMPORTANT NOTES
IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT HAVE A CONFIRMATION LIKE MY OTHER SCRIPTS, IT WILL TRIGGER UPON RUNNING AS ADMINISTRATOR. PLEASE BE SURE YOU ARE READY TO RESET YOUR IP TO AUTOMATIC BEFORE RUNNING.
Please run this as administrator as you need elevated permissions to effectively change network settings using CMD.

Remember to always be careful when running scripts that modify your system settings. It’s a good practice to understand what a script does before running it. You can see the raw code since its a .bat file so if you are unsure of any command lines you can ask here, or look them up yourself as the entire code is only 16 lines.



## DISCLAIMER
DISCLAIMER: This batch file was written for personal utility and for educational/experience purposes only. Do not mis-use this file. I do not hold any responsibility of the use/misuse of this script.
The code is open-source, of course! As it's a .bat file, please save it as such if you are going to copy the raw code to your notepad.
